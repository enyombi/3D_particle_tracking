packing_geometrical_p.png = an reconstructed image of packing w/color coding of particles.  The darker the particle the more geometrical neighbors. Lighter particles have fewer geometrical neighbors 

packing_mechanical_p.png = same reconstructed packing as packing_geometrical_p.png but here particle are colored based on the number of physical contacts (i.e., touching neighbors). Same color scheme as used for packing_geometrical_p.png: The darker the particle, the more physical contacts that particle has and vice versa

Programs that generated both packing_geometrical_p.png and packing_mechanical_p.png are in ../code_movies_and_images/buildPacking30may2014_1_30mayRCP
