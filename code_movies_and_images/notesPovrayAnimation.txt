movie#the following makes many .png files of the 3D image of a packing generated by movie_p.pov.  Each .png file is a frame from rotating around the packing generated by movie_p.pov.  The .ini file reapeatedly calls the movie_p.pov and generates an image of the same packing viewed from a different angle.

$ povray movie_p.ini

#these files were then moved to ~/povray_myfiles/povray_animation/moviePacking

$ mv movie_p0* moviePacking/
$ mv movie_p1* moviePacking/
$ mv movie_p2* moviePacking/
$ mv movie_p3* moviePacking/
$ mv movie_p4* moviePacking/

#â€¦then each .png file was converted into a .jpg file and all .jpg files were moved into ~/povray_myfiles/povray_animation/moviePacking/jpegFiles.  

$ cd moviePacking/
$ chmod u+x pngTojpg.sh
$ ./pngTojpg.sh
$ mv *.jpg jpegFiles/


# .jpg filenames must only be numbers to make a move, therefore ~/povray_myfiles/povray_animation/moviePacking/jpegFiles/ReadInAndOut.sh renames each movie_p01.jpg to 001.jpg, etc. 

$ cd jpegFiles/
$ chmod u+x filenameTonumber.sh
$ ./filenameTonumber.sh

#now to make the movie:

$ ffmpeg -r 10 -b 1800 -i %03d.jpg test1800.mp4
