movie_packing_REAL.mov is a real, 3D-image of the SAME packing taken at the SAME time using green and red fluorescent markers. A Leica confocal microscope was used to capture these 3D image

movie30may2014_1_30mayRCP_4xALL.mp4 is a reconstructed image of the packing in movie_packing_REAL.mov.  This was generated using Persistence of Vision Raytracer (aka pov-ray; http://www.povray.org/).  See ../code_movies_and_results


buildPacking30may2014_1_30mayRCP.mp4 is another image of the packing in movie_packing_REAL.mov.  This in earlier reconstruction of the same packing. I was just playing around...I wanted to see what the packing looks like from the inside-out.  Generally, the darker the particle the more contacts that particle has.

Note: keep in mind, movie30may2014_1_30mayRCP_4xALL.mp4 and buildPacking30may2014_1_30mayRCP.mp4 are early reconstructions of the packing. So particle-centers, sizes, and number of contacts (which is represented as the color of the particle) might be slightly off. These were adjusted later and the findings/interpretation (physics) were published here https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04702
