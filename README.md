# 3D_particle_tracking

__Context__: PhD research (<font color = 'blue'> https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04702 </font>) 
studying random packing of collids for developing statistical physics models that predict random structure 

__Content of this repository__: programs and some of the results (i.e., .png, .mov, .m4v) of those programs used...

1) to locate >1000 particles in a 3D confocal image, 
2) to approximate the size of particles, and 
3) to identify contacts between particles
